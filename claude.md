# Mobile Lectures

Beamer slides for a Mobile Applications Development course, written in LaTeX.

## Workflow for humans

- Uses **LaTeX Workshop** VS Code extension
- Build the `.tex` file and the PDF preview updates automatically
- Don't try to embed videos, it cannot be done properly with Latex. Instead upload video to cloud and use HREF

## Build

LaTeX Workshop handles compilation. The main workflow is edit → save → auto-build → preview PDF.
