In the article **"94% of My Users Disappeared in 30 Days (Until I Fixed These 7 Things),"** the author (writing under the name Alax Henry or similar handles like yogxworld) describes a common "leaky bucket" problem where an app successfully acquired users but failed to keep them. By addressing specific friction points and psychological triggers, the author improved Day-30 retention from **6% to 32%**.

Here are the **7 things** they fixed to stop the user churn:

### 1. The "Empty State" Problem
New users were landing on a blank dashboard. Without data or content to interact with, they felt lost.
* **The Fix:** Added "placeholder" or "dummy" data and onboarding tooltips that showed users what the app *could* look like once they started using it.

### 2. Excessive Onboarding Friction
The app originally asked for too much information (social logins, profile setup, preferences) before letting the user see the value.
* **The Fix:** Implemented "Lazy Registration." Users could try the core features immediately, and the app only asked for a sign-up when it was absolutely necessary to save progress.

### 3. Missing the "Aha! Moment"
Users weren't reaching the core value of the app fast enough. The author realized most users quit before ever experiencing the primary benefit.
* **The Fix:** Redesigned the user flow to lead the user to one "small win" within the first 60 seconds of opening the app.

### 4. Overwhelming Notification Noise
The app was sending generic, high-frequency notifications that users found annoying, leading them to disable alerts or delete the app.
* **The Fix:** Switched to "Event-Triggered" notifications. Alerts were only sent based on specific user actions or highly relevant personalized updates, making them feel helpful rather than spammy.

### 5. Slow Performance & Loading States
High latency during the first session caused users to perceive the app as "broken."
* **The Fix:** Optimized the initial load and added skeleton screens (animated placeholders). This made the app *feel* faster even if the backend was still processing, reducing the "bounce" rate during loading.

### 6. Lack of Re-engagement Loops
Once a user finished a task, there was no reason for them to come back the next day.
* **The Fix:** Introduced "Hooks" like daily streaks, progress bars, or "coming up next" previews. These gamification elements gave users a psychological reason to return.

### 7. Ignoring Qualitative Feedback
The author was looking at *what* was happening (analytics) but didn't know *why*.
* **The Fix:** Added a simple "Why are you leaving?" survey for users who hadn't opened the app in a week. The feedback revealed a specific bug and a confusing UI element that analytics alone hadn't flagged.

### Key Takeaway
The author concludes that **retention is a product of the first 5 minutes.** By reducing the "Time to Value" (TTV) and removing friction in the initial session, you can exponentially increase the lifetime value of your user base.
